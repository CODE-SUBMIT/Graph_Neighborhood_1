# Graph_Neighborhood_1
First and Second Neighborhood Combination of Adjacency Matrix for Graph Learning 

## Overview
A easily implemented neighborhood combination for common graph learning including supervised&semi-supervised graph classification,
graph link prediction, graph edge generation$classification. The proposed approach improve the performance of several graph models,
such as GCN, GIN,LDS-GNN,GMNN,PWL,GRAPH_Unet, Graphite, VGAE, MGCNK, CHEBNET and etc al. It's an official implementation of the Paper[A Direct
Neighborhood Combination of the Adjacency Matrix for Graph Learning] based on several graph model implementation such as
