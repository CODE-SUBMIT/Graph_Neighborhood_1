# Experiment No4:

## Example
 The implementation corresponds to the variant ```GMNN W/o Attr. in p``` in the Table 4 of the paper. To run the codes,  execute ```python run_cora.py```. ```python run_citeseer.py```. ```python run_pubmed.py```. Then the program will print the results over 100 runs with seeds 1~100 for the model (s)GMNN.
